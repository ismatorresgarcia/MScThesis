***Modelling the influence of the shape of a plasma channel in the amplification of XUV beams***

This is a project for my Master's Thesis written during the academic year 2022/2023 at the Polytechnic University of Madrid.

The goal was to study the amplification of a HOH seed injected through a niquel-like plasma column of kripton and to modify the numerical codes 
employed, for example, the plasma channel geometry, to see if the experimental evidence agrees with the results obtained during the numerical simulations.
