**Master's Final Project**

***Modelling the influence of the shape of a plasma channel in the amplification of XUV beams***

This project was part of my Master's Thesis, completed during the academic year 2022/2023 at the Polytechnic University of Madrid.

The goal of this project was to study the amplification of a HOH seed injected into a nickel-like plasma column of krypton and to modify the numerical codes used, including adjustments to the plasma channel geometry. The aim was to determine whether the experimental evidence aligns with the results obtained from the numerical simulations.
